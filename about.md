My name is Gabriel Gohier-Roy and I'm from Montreal.

I was once an electrical engineer. In 2011, I was introduced to the world of .NET while working on industrial smart cameras and I haven't looked back since.

These days I do web development using such things as Web API, Entity Framework, and Bootstrap among others.
